### Regression Task
- predict the critical temperature of superconductors based only on the most important features
- implemented Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Principal Component Regression (PCR) to reduce dimensionality of data

### Classification Task
- predict the occupancy of a given room based on sensor data
- implemented Random Forest Classifier and optimization of key hyperparameters
